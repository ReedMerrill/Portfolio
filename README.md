# Welcome to my portfolio :wave:

Explore the above links to see my portfolio projects:

1. sampleReddit: a Python library that makes it easy for researchers to perform snowball samples of Reddit data.
2. Toxicity Data Collection: My work to collect and clean Reddit comments and classify them according to if they contained toxic content. This project contains an early version of my sampleReddit code. It also deploys a transformer neural network model and showcases robust data cleaning and collection procedures.
3. Multilabel Emotion Classification: A project that classifies Reddit comments into six emotion categories using a deep recurrent neural network.
4. Back Propogation: My own implementation of the back propogation algorithm used in neural networks during gradient descent. This project hugely enriched my understanding of neural network optimization.
